# Build macOS ARM64 wheels and source distribution
# Addresses: https://github.com/google/atheris/issues/52
#
# NOTE: This workflow builds macOS ARM64 only. Linux wheels require building
# LLVM from source - see linux-wheels.yaml for Docker-based Linux builds.
#
# KNOWN LIMITATION: macOS wheels currently require Homebrew LLVM at runtime
# (brew install llvm) due to libc++ dependency. See TODO for future fix.
#
# Publishing is handled by release.yaml which waits for all build workflows.
